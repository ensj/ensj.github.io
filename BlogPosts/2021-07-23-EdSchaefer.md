This is a review of the research project that I was a part of in late 2020 to spring 2021, under professor Ed Schaefer in Santa Clara University. I was working with Shaunak Mashalkar at the time.

## Prelude

So back in like 2019 or so, a professor called Carl Pomerance came to SCU to teach number theory for a quarter. The subject sounded interesting, and I was already hyped up by basic number theory from cryptography, so I decided to give it a whirl. As it turns out, the professor turned out to be one of the best number theorists alive right now, and he was equally amazing at teaching the subject. I was absolutely enamored by it. In the middle of one of his lectures, he decided to throw us an open problem he found with two of his other colleagues long ago.

Find a Fibonacci Pseudoprime that is both a base-2 pseudoprime and is 2 or 3 mod 5.

There's a few things that sound a little confusing here, so let's go over them first. What's a pseudoprime, anyway?!

## Pseudoprimes

Prime numbers play a particularly important role in the world of number theory.
